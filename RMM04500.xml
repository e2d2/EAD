			<p>Chinese export watercolors were painted in the port cities of China for sale to
				western customers in the late 18th and 19th centuries. Works were done in watercolor
				or gouache, initially on European papers, particularly paper produced by the English
				firm of J. Whatman, but later on pith"paper," produced from the pith of the Chinese
				plant tongcao (generally identified as Tetrapanax papyrifera). Many of the
				watercolors were done in sets such as trades, domestic interiors and gardens, boats,
				birds, mandarins, punishments, etc. Particularly popular were sets illustrating tea
				culture, the silk industry, and the making of porcelain since they explained the
				products that were being sent to the west. The watercolors were painted in
				workshops, using mass production techniques, so that there may be more than one
				version of the same "original." The colors used were those common in Chinese
				painting, but there is a clear tendency for primary colors to predominate later in
				the 19th century, particularly on the pith paper paintings. They may have originally
				been sold in loose paper bindings, but were frequently rebound in Europe in more
				elaborate leather bindings.</p>
